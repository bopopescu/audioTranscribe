### Inspiration\
The idea of Totomi originated from an urgent email. A student was looking for a notetaker for a class because he was suffering from hearing disability.\
\
About 37.5 million American adults report troubles with hearing. That is about 15% of the American population. Furthermore, more than 360 million people suffer from disabling hearing loss across the globe.\
\
Therefore, we wanted to develop a tool, a seamless integration with their daily life, that can help facilitate everyday conversation with the world. So that our classmate could take a class without needing a notetaker.
